This project focuses on applying Genetic Algorithms to find the optimal path connecting a set of randomly generated cities, aiming to minimize the total distance traveled. This approach involves creating a map object that defines the space for the cities and executing the genetic algorithm to evolve the solution over generations.

Main Features:
Generation of a map with randomly placed cities.
Utilization of genetic algorithm techniques to find the shortest possible route.
Analysis of different configurations and their impacts on the algorithm's performance.
The detailed documentation, including the solution's description, methodology, and analysis of results with various genetic algorithm parameters, is available in the accompanying PDF document
